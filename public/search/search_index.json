It also includes details about the dataset we will be using and the example notebooks that will guide our exercises. Coding environment To ensure a smooth experience, we have set up a ready-to-use environment where all dependencies and example datasets are pre-installed. This means you won\u2019t need to worry about installing anything manually\u2014everything is configured and ready to go. The environment is hosted on notebook servers , which are remote computing resources designed to facilitate interactive coding. These servers allow users to create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks, which contain text, code, equations, and visualizations. Running code on a remote notebook server means computations will be performed on a powerful server rather than your local computer. This provides faster processing, access to specialized resources, and the flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection. For this workshop, we will be using two remote services: NOC's Data Science Platform (DSP) \u2013 for NOC staff: More information JASMIN \u2013 for external users: More information Tutorials The following tutorials will be used during the workshop: 1) Introduction \u2013 Learn how to run a simple pipeline using Paidiverpy. 2) Benthic Dataset \u2013 Instructions and exercises for working with a benthic dataset. 3) Pelagic Dataset \u2013 Instructions and exercises for working with a pelagic dataset.

Log in using your NOC Southampton UNIX username and password. If you do not have an account or have forgotten your credentials, please ask us for a temporary login details. Select an image to run. You can choose the default option and click Start . Once started, the Jupyter Notebook interface will appear. You can create a new notebook or open a terminal. Your DSP home directory and group workspaces will be accessible from within the notebook environment. Setting up the PAIDIVERPY Conda Environment A preconfigured PAIDIVERPY Conda environment is available for use. This environment includes all necessary packages and dependencies and is built using the environment.yml file from the Paidiverpy GitHub repository . Since the environment is stored in a non-standard location ( /groups/paidiver/paidiver-env ), Jupyter will not detect it automatically. Follow these steps to set it up: 1. Open a Terminal From the Jupyter launcher, click the Terminal icon. 2. Register the PAIDIVER Kernel Run the following command: mamba run -p /groups/paidiver/paidiver-env python -m ipykernel install --user --name PAIDIVER 3. Troubleshooting If the command above fails, try running these commands first, then repeat step 2: mamba init exec bash 4. Launch Jupyter with the PAIDIVER Environment Open a new Jupyter launcher by clicking File > New Launcher . A new notebook and console option named PAIDIVER should now be available (this may take about a minute to appear): - Click on PAIDIVER to open a notebook. 5. Verify the Installation Run the following command in the first cell: import paidiverpy paidiverpy.__version__ If the output is 0.1.2 , your environment is correctly set up. Downloading the PAIDIVER Example Code To obtain the example code for the workshop: Open a terminal and run: bash cd ~ git clone https://github.com/paidiver/paidiver-workshop.git This will clone the repository into your DSP home directory. Ensure you are in your home directory by clicking the home folder icon in the Jupyter file browser. Open the paidiver-workshop folder and navigate to the tutorials subfolder. You will find three Jupyter Notebook tutorials that will be used in this workshop. Running an Example Notebook Open the paidiver-workshop folder containing the cloned repository. Navigate to the tutorials folder. Open the introduction.ipynb notebook. If prompted to select a kernel, choose PAIDIVER .
